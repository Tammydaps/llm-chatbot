BELOW IS AN EXAMPLE ON HOW TO WRITE A TEMPLATE ON HOW TO WRITE A PROPOSAL USING CYPHERCRESCENT STANDARD


Introduction

CypherCrescent R & D has been conducting research in areas of integrated production system modelling and real-time process monitoring. We would like to combine the results of these efforts into a solid solution for oil and gas facility surveillance.


The Problem

In the E & P industry we are data rich but information poor. Real-time data gathering is not an issue, but validation and usage of such data is. For example, timely well-by-well production surveillance and allocation often remains a problem.  Traditionally this problem is often attempted using periodic well test (monthly allocation) in test separators and multiphase meters. This method cannot capture important changes in between tests – snap shots are inadequate.

Proposed Solution

The solution we are proposing combines (i) well and process flow physical models (to provide real time estimates of well production and flows in surface facility network) and (ii) continuous real time data-driven physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) model for well and network flow monitoring and surveillance (this utilises the flood of data available). Model in (i) is used to prime and bootstrap model (ii).

PINNs are a type of universal function approximators that can embed the knowledge of any physical laws that govern a given data-set in the learning process, and can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs).  They overcome the low data availability of some engineering systems that makes most state-of-the-art machine learning techniques lack robustness, rendering them ineffective in these scenarios. The prior knowledge of general physical laws acts in the training of neural networks (NNs) as a regularization agent that limits the space of admissible solutions, increasing the correctness of the function approximation. This way, embedding this prior information into a neural network results in enhancing the information content of the available data, facilitating the learning algorithm to capture the right solution and to generalize well even with a low amount of training examples. 

Importance of Facility Surveillance

    • Various anomalies and data errors in the operational data acquisition systems become apparent.
    • Key application is to keep track of wells. Hence, well problems and instrumentation are quickly detected.
    • Provides diagnostics and status information on the validity of the measured data. This allows personnel to identify data problems immediately.
    • Asset managers are suddenly presented with real time information on the state of their asset.

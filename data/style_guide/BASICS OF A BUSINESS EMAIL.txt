How to Reply a Mail
When replying a mail with other people in copy, reply to everyone and ensure no one in the originating mail is left out.
## Subject Line
A good subject line must be S. P. A. M.
S – Short
P – Personable
A – Attention-getting
M – Meaningful to the reader

1. Short
The subject line should have a maximum of 49 characters. The characters also include spaces.

2. Personable
The subject line should appeal to and relate personally to the reader. Imagine what the reader wants to hear from you and use that knowledge to craft the subject lines.

3. Attention-getting
The subject line most importantly, aims at grabbing the reader’s attention. One way to do this is using humour. Humour is a wonderful way to attract attention to emails as long as it is relevant and suitable to the readers. 

4. Meaningful to the reader
Subject lines of emails should be meaningful to the readers. To achieve this, the following should be adhered to:


	Exclusivity
Email subject lines should imply exclusivity. Subject lines about special services to clients, VIP invitations and privileges can make the readers feel really privileged, and therefore more likely to open the email.

	Specificity
Subject lines should address specific issues or items that relate to the readers. Vagueness or ambiguity should be avoided.

	Believability
Believability implies that subject lines should be credible enough to the readers. Don’t promise something with your subject line that you don’t deliver on in the body of the message. There should be consistency between the subject line and the body of the message.

Subject Line Mistakes to Avoid
1.	THE ALL-CAPS SCREAMER 
Avoid all caps in your subject lines because it sounds like you are yelling at your readers. This also applies to the body of the message.


2.	The Punctuation Abuser!!!!!
Like all-caps, punctuations should not be abused. When you use more than one punctuation mark it will seem as if you are yelling (!!!). One exclamation point or one question mark serves its purpose.

3.	The Generic Nature
Subject lines should be specific in nature. Avoid the use of subject lines that are generic. Telling the recipients what exactly to expect in the mail will go a long way in making them read the mail. 
	
Generic subject lines such as “Weekly Updates,” “Monthly Review” or “Daily Highlights” are not enticing or descriptive enough. It is ideal to always highlight your most interesting topics in the subject line.

4.	The Desperate Crier, i.e. “Open Me!”
Begging for an open makes you sound desperate and will not give you the engagement you desire. 

5.	The Grammar or Spelling Mistake Eyesore
Prevent grammar and spelling errors by using spell check; ask at least one other person to proofread your entire email including the subject line.
6.3	Salutation
Use the recipient’s first name in the greeting when you have a friendly relationship with the recipient. 

Greeting: Dear Chukwuemeka,
Use a courtesy title, a professional title and a last name when you have a formal relationship with the recipient.

Greeting: Dear Mr Chukwuemeka,  
Dear Prof. Chukwuemeka                    

Use a title and a last name when you writing to someone who is much older than you or someone you hold in high esteem.

Use the title “Miss” or “Mrs” when you are sure that a woman would prefer to be addressed as such. Otherwise use the title Ms or leave the title out.

Use “Miss” for a young girl who is less than 18, “Ms” for an unmarried woman who is above 18 and for a woman whose marital status you are not sure of, and “Mrs” for a married woman.

Use “Master” for a young boy who is less than 18, “Mr” for both a man who is above 18 and a married man. 

Mses is for more than one woman with the title “Ms”. 

Messrs is for more than one man with the title Mr. Its use is quite formal and traditional. You may use Mr. with each man’s name instead.       

For communications outside Nigeria, use “Mx” when you write to someone who prefers a gender-neutral courtesy title. If you have transgender friends and associates, find out which courtesy titles they prefer.

## Complimentary Closing
When you do not use the name of the recipient. 
When you use “Dear Sir” or “Dear Madam” as the salutation, the complimentary closing will be “Yours faithfully”, not Yours Faithfully, not Yours sincerely.

For example, “Dear Mr Friday” or “Dear Mrs Kate” as the salutation. 

The complimentary closing will be “Yours sincerely”, not Your Sincerely, not Yours Faithfully.

The invented title Ms. has widely displaced Miss on both sides of the Atlantic. Ms conflates Miss and Mrs to provide a feminine form that, like Mr, does not indicate marital status. 
British usage: Ms Jones
American usage: Ms. Jones

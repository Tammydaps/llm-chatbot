Example 1: The year 2015 has been regarded as the most profitable year in the history of the company

How to write the month and day
Write the month and then the date in numerals.

Example: Ken’s birthday is January 20.

If the date is a single digit, i.e. any day before 10, use “0” before the number to make it double digits.

Example: Helen’s birthday is June 03.

How to write dates with days of the week
Use a comma after the days of the week and a comma before the year.

Example: I will be returning from my trip on Saturday, March 02, 2019.

How to write centuries
When writing centuries, do not use apostrophe before s.

Example 1: I prefer the fashion styles of the 1900s (correct)

Example 2: I prefer the fashion styles of the 1900’s (wrong)

Example 3: I prefer the fashion styles of the nineteen hundreds (correct)

Example 4: I prefer the fashion styles of the Nineteenth Century (correct)

How to write decades
Decades should be written as two-digit numbers with an apostrophe before them and an s after them.

Example 1: Mary graduated from the college in the ’70s.

Example 2: Mary graduated from the college in the 1970s.

Example 3: Mary graduated from the college in the nineties.

Writing dates as numerals
Use the following format with hyphens in between:

dd(day)-mm(month)-year

Example: To write June 16, 2019 as numerals will be:
16-06-2019

## Time
Rule 1
Use numerals when writing time.

Example: 
1. He arrived his office today at 8:30 a.m., and not – 
    He arrived his office today at eight-thirty a.m.

2. The children are expected to go to bed at 9.00 p.m.

Note how the time is written, and how they are spaced: “8:30 a.m. and 9.00 p.m.”

Rule 2
It is better to use noon and midnight rather than 12:00 p.m. or 12:00 a.m.

Example: 
1. Employees’ lunch break commences at 12.00 noon.
2. All applicants are expected to send in their applications before 12.00 midnight today.

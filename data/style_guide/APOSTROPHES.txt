# APOSTROPHES
Apostrophe (‘)
Apostrophe is used to indicate either possession (e.g., Anita's book) or the omission of letters or numbers (e.g., can’t; class of ’99).

Rule 1:
Form the possessive case of a singular noun by adding an apostrophe and an s, even if the singular noun ends in s, x, or z. 

Example: I know that both Mr Silas and Miss Juan have dogs, but I do not know if Mr Silas’s dogs are wild.

Rule 2: 
For plural nouns that end in s, form the possessive case by adding only an apostrophe. 

Example: From the election results, it is clear Donald Trump was the masses’ choice.)

Guide
	For plural nouns that end in s, form the possessive case by adding only an apostrophe. (e.g., From the election results, it is clear Donald Trump was the masses’ choice.)
	Avoid forming possessives from company names.
	Do not use the possessive form of product names or feature names.
	Differentiate between the contraction it’s (it is) and possessive pronoun its.
	Never use an apostrophe with possessive pronouns (yours, not your’s).
	Do not use an apostrophe to indicate the plural of a singular noun (programmes, not programme’s).

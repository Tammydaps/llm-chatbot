# BRACKETS () []

## Round Brackets ()
Use round brackets to separate off information that is not essential to the meaning of the rest of the sentence.

Example: Mike Tyson (in the 1990s) was the heavy weight boxing champion.

## Square Brackets []
Square brackets are mainly used to enclose words added by someone other than the original writer or speaker, typically in order to clarify the situation:

Example: Mrs Ifi [the lecturer] is always polite to her students

If brackets are used at the end of a sentence, the full stop should be placed outside, as the final punctuation:

Example: A good knowledge of the use of the computer is a basic requirement (at least to be able to secure a good job).

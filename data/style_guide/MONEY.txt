# MONEY

Rule 1
Currency symbols should be placed before the number, with no spaces.

Example: His monthly remuneration is N200,000.

Rule 2
Thousands should be separated by commas.

Example: Ken was fortunate to find N5,000 in his bag. 


Rule 3
Decimals should be separated by full stops.

Example: Fredâ€™s total tax for the month is N550.88. 

Rule 4 
When you reach numbers in the millions and billions, write out the full word (instead of all those zeros).

Example: The total value of the newly awarded contract is N2.5 billion. 

Rule 5
Do not write out the currency if you've already indicated an amount with a currency symbol.

Example: I just received a credit alert of N10 million from my bank. AND NOT
I just received a credit alert of N10 million naira from my bank.

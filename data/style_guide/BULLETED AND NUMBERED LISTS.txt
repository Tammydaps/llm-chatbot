# BULLETED AND NUMBERED LISTS
Bulleted and numbered lists could be used at any time to create a list. However, use numbered list to show steps in a process.

The rules below apply to both bullet points and numbered lists.

## Punctuating Bullet Points

Rule 1:
Use a full stop after every bullet point that is a sentence. 

Rule 2:
Use a full stop after every bullet point or numbered list that completes the introductory stem. 

Example of Bullet Points that Complete the Introductory Stem
I prefer living in Port Harcourt because of its:
•	Garden City status.
•	Clement weather condition.
•	Economic importance to Nigeria.

Rule 3:
Use no punctuation after bullet points that are not sentences and that do not complete the stem. 
Below is another example that does not need full stops.
These are the reasons why I prefer living in Port Harcourt:
•	Garden City status
•	Clement weather condition
•	Economic importance to Nigeria

Exception to the Rule of Putting Full Stops After Bullet Points that Complete the Stem Sentence
If the bullet points are one word or a short phrase, do not use end punctuation. 

Example:
I prefer living in Port Harcourt because of its:
•	Weather
•	Culture
•	Business opportunities
•	Security

## Capitalisation of Bullet Points
Rule 1:
Capitalise a bullet point list if the introductory stem that precedes the bullet point is followed by a punctuation mark

Example
I prefer living in Port Harcourt because of its:
•	Weather
•	Culture
•	Business opportunities
•	Security

Rule 2:
Do not capitalise a bullet point if the introductory stem that precedes the bullet point is not followed by a punctuation mark

Example
I prefer living in Port Harcourt because of its
•	weather
•	culture
•	business opportunities
•	security

# ELLIPSES (…)
An ellipsis is a punctuation mark consisting of three dots.

Rule 1:
Use an ellipsis when omitting a word, phrase, line, paragraph, or more from a quoted passage. 

Example: 
Full quotation: "As your leaders, we are committed to your better welfare, development, and overall satisfaction.” 

With ellipsis:
"As your leaders, we are committed to your… overall satisfaction.”

Note: There should be no space between the last character preceding the ellipsis. But there should be just one space between the ellipsis and the next character as seen in the example above.

Rule 2:
Ellipses could be used at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence.

Rule 3:
Use ellipses to express hesitation, changes of mood, suspense, or thoughts trailing off. Writers also use ellipses to indicate a pause or wavering in an otherwise straightforward sentence.

Example:
1. He called… But there was no answer
2. I’m so happy because…

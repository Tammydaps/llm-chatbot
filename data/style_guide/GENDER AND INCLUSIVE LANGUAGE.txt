# GENDER AND INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE

Rule 1
When there is a choice between a word which specifies a person's gender and a word which does not, you should choose the neutral one unless their gender is relevant to the context. 

Example: Use chair or chairperson instead of chairman, or head teacher instead of headmaster/headmistress. 

On the other hand, it would sound improper to say, for example, ‘she is the best head teacher’ instead of ‘she is the best head mistress’,

Rule 2
If you want to refer to humanity in general, use phrases such as the human race or humankind rather than mankind.

Rule 3
If you are making general statements, avoid using specific gender pronouns like, he, she, him, her, herself, himself; except where the gender of the person is known. You can use plural pronouns like, they, their, them, themselves (or themself), which can also be used to refer to singular nouns.

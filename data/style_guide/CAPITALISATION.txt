# CAPITALISATION
Proper capitalisation helps to preserve an intended information transmission from sender to receiver both in informal and formal communication settings. It is an important aspect of writing as it relates directly to the organisation of the written document, whereas, improper use of capitalisation can greatly affect the semantics and structure of the written document. 
The purpose of capitalisation is to help show the reader the importance of different words. For example, let us look at how capitalisation can show importance with some nouns. Remember, a noun is the person, place, thing, or idea. 

Look at these two phrases: 'The White House' and 'the white house.' Because the first phrase is capitalised, you as the reader know it is more important. Capitalised, it refers to the house the President of the United States lives in; lowercase, it refers to any house that is white. In this example, you can see how capitalisation shows the clear meaning of words.

## Forms of Capitalisation
The common forms of capitalisation are:
1.	Upper Case Capitalisation: when all the letters in a sentence are capitalised 
Example: EDITORIAL STYLE GUIDE
2.	Lower case capitalisation: when all the letters in a sentence are not capitalised
Example: editorial style guide
3.	Title Case Capitalisation: only the first letter of each word in a sentence is capitalised 
Example: Editorial Style Guide
4.	Sentence Case Capitalisation: only the first letter of the word starting the sentence is capitalised
Example: Editorial style guide
5.	Toggle Case Capitalisation: any letter of the word can be capitalised in no particular order, this is usually done for aesthetic reasons. 
Example: EditoRiaL stYle GuiDe
Note: This type of capitalisation is not used in CypherCrescent.

N/B: The upper, lower and toggle case capitalisation types are not exactly challenging. The complication in capitalisation lies with the title case and sentence case capitalisation.

## Rules of Capitalisation
There are standard rules of capitalisations set globally for effective communication. These rules serve as guides to the proper use of capitalisation in writing. 
Capitalise the First Word of a Sentence

Capitalise the first word of a sentence.

Capitalise proper nouns
A proper noun is a name used for a person, place, or organisation, spelled with an initial capital letter, e.g. Ahmed, Port Harcourt, Nigeria, United Nations.

# COMMAS (,)

Rule 1
Comma is used to separate items in a list, words or group of words.
Example:
1.	The manager told the staff to bring to work their identification cards, offer letters, and payslips.
2.	The newly elected president promised the citizens of the country increased minimum wage, improved housing, better healthcare, and free education.

Rule 2
Use a comma to separate two adjectives when the order of the adjectives is interchangeable.

Example:
1.	Port Harcourt is a clean, beautiful city.
We could also say: Port Harcourt is a beautiful, clean city.

2.	The tourists lodged in an expensive holiday resort
We would not say: The tourists lodged in a holiday expensive resort.

In the above example, comma is not needed.

Another way to determine if a comma is needed is to mentally put and between the two adjectives. If the result still makes sense, add the comma. In the examples above, a clean and beautiful city makes sense, but an expensive and holiday resort does not.

Rule 3
In sentences where two independent clauses are joined by connectors such as and, or, but, etc., put a comma at the end of the first clause.

Example:
Incorrect: He took his child to school and he drove the car.
Correct: He took his child to school, and he drove the car.
Some writers omit the comma if the clauses are short.

Example:
I am fair and she is dark.

Rule 4
If the subject does not appear in front of the second verb, a comma is generally unnecessary.

Example: 
She left her office but did not take her car key.

Rule 5
When starting a sentence with a dependent clause, use a comma after it.

Example: 
If you are happy with me, join me to celebrate.

Follow the same principle with introductory phrases.

Example: 
With the stage fully set, the dancers trooped out to perform.

Rule 6
A comma is usually unnecessary when the sentence starts with an independent clause followed by a dependent clause.

Example: 
Please inform the manager if you are not coming to work.

Rule 7
Use commas to set off nonessential words, clauses, and phrases.

Example: 
Incorrect: Jane the janitor swept the floor.
Correct: Jane, the janitor, swept the floor.
Incorrect: The students know that they were wrong refused to take correction.
Correct: The students, knowing they were wrong, refused to take corrections.

Other examples:
Incorrect: My cousin, Mike arrived.
Correct: My cousin, Mike, arrived.
Incorrect: The three employees, Amina, Kola, and Jane are off duty.
Correct: The three employees, Amina, Kola, and Jane, are off duty.

Rule 8
If something or someone is sufficiently identified, the description that follows is considered nonessential and should be surrounded by commas.

Example:
1. Amaka, who has the book, is in the classroom.
If we already know which Amaka is meant, the description is not essential.

2. The girl who has the book is in the classroom.
We do not know which girl is meant without further description; therefore, no commas are used.
Rule 9
Use a comma after certain words that introduce a sentence, such as well, yes, why, hello, hey, etc.

Example:
1. Why, I can't believe this!
2. No, you can't have a dollar.

Rule 10
Use commas to set off the name, nickname, term of endearment, or title of a person directly addressed.

Example:
1. Will you, Nkem, do me this favour?
2. Yes, my dear, I will.
3. Good day, Teacher.

Rule 11
Use a comma to separate the day of the month from the year, and—what most people forget!—always put one after the year, also.

Example: 
It was in the Guardian’s March 05, 2018, edition.
No comma is necessary for just the month and year.

Example: It was in a March 2018 article.

Rule 12
Use a comma to separate a city from its state, and remember to put one after the state, also.

Example:
I'm from Port Harcourt, South-South, region.

Rule 13
Use commas to introduce or interrupt direct quotations.

Example:
He said, "I don't care."
"Why," I asked, "don't you care?"

Rule 14
If the quotation comes before he said, she wrote, they reported, Dana insisted, or a similar attribution, end the quoted material with a comma, even if it is only one word.
Example:
1. "I don't care," he said.
2. "Stop," he said.

Rule 15
If a quotation functions as a subject or object in a sentence, it might not need a comma.

Example:
1. Is "I don't care" all you can say to me?
2. Saying "Stop the car" was a mistake.

Rule 16
If a quoted question ends in midsentence, the question mark replaces a comma.

Example: 
"Will you still be my friend?" she asked.

Rule 17
Use a comma to separate a statement from a question.

Example: 
I can go, can't I?

Rule 18
Use a comma to separate contrasting parts of a sentence.

Example: 
That is my money, not yours.

Rule 18
Use a comma before and after certain introductory words or terms, such as namely, that is, i.e., e.g., and for instance, when they are followed by a series of items.

Example: 
You may be required to bring many items, e.g., sleeping bags, pans, and warm clothing.

Rule 19
A comma should precede the term etc. Many authorities also recommend a comma after etc. when it is placed midsentence.

Example: 
Sleeping bags, pans, warm clothing, etc., are in the tent.

## Serial Commas
The serial comma (sometimes referred to as the Oxford comma) is usually the final comma in a list of things.

Use serial commas in a list of things.

Example: The student had in his bag a pen, an eraser, and books.

# API Directory Structure

This directory contains the source code for an API, organized into different components.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure is organized as follows:

- `api/`: Root directory of the API.
  - `v1/`: Directory containing version 1 of the API.
    - `models/`: Directory for API models.
      - `models.py`: Module containing API models.
    - `routes/`: Directory for API routes.
      - `error_handler.py`: Module containing error handling logic.
      - `v1.py`: Module containing routes for API version 1.

## Components

### `v1/` Directory

This directory contains version 1 of the API. Each version may have its own set of models and routes.

### `models/` Directory

The `models/` directory contains API models. Models represent the structure and schema of data used within the API.

### `routes/` Directory

The `routes/` directory contains API routes. Routes define the endpoints and request handlers for the API.

- `error_handler.py`: This module contains error handling logic for the API.
- `v1.py`: This module contains the routes for API version 1.

## Usage

To use the API, run the appropriate server script (e.g., `v1.py`) to start the API server. Then, you can send requests to the defined endpoints to interact with the API.

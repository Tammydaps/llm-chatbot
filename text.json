          2019 as numerals will be:\n16-06-2019\n\n\n\nHow to write dates in presentation slides\n\n## Time\nRule 1\nUse numerals when writing time.\n\nExample: \n1. He arrived his office today at 8: 30 a.m., and not – \n    He arrived his office today at eight-thirty a.m.\n\n2. The children are expected to go to bed at 9.00 p.m.\n\nNote how the time is written, and how they are spaced: “8: 30 a.m. and 9.00 p.m.”\n\nRule 2\nIt is better to use noon and midnight rather than 12: 00 p.m. or 12: 00 a.m.\n\nExample: \n1. Employees’ lunch break commences at 12.00 noon.\n2. All applicants are expected to send in their applications before 12.00 midnight today.\n\n\n        "quotation context"\n        # QUOTATION MARKS\n\nRule 1\nAlways use double quotation marks. Use single quotation marks only for quotations within quotations. \n\nExample: In his keynote address, the speaker said: “To be an inventor, you must use your imaginative power. In the words of Albert Einstein, ‘Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.’”\n\nRule 2\nUse double quotation marks to set off a direct (word-for-word) quotation.\n\nExample:\nCorrect: “Determination is an important key to success,” the teacher told the students.\n\nRule 3\nAlways capitalise the first word in a complete quotation, even midsentence.\n\nExample: The President said, “Our economy is coming out of recession.”\n\nRule 4\nDo not capitalise quoted material that continues a sentence.\nExample: The President said that “our economy is coming out of recession.”\n\nRule 5\nUse commas to introduce or interrupt direct quotations.\n\nExample: Ron began by saying, “Hello All.”\n\nRule 6\nIf a quotation functions as a subject or object in a sentence, it might not need a comma.\n\nExample:\nIs “let the sleeping dog lie” all you have to say?\n\nRule 7\nFull stops and commas should always go inside quotation marks.\n\nExample:\nThe lecturer said,
          "Everyone stand." Then he said again,
          "Leave the classroom," then,
          "Come back to your seats."\n\nRule 8\nThe placement of question marks with quotation marks follows logic. If a question is within the quoted material, a question mark should be placed inside the quotation marks.\n\nExample:\n1.\tThe man asked the lady, “Have you had lunch today?”\nThe question Have you had lunch today? is part of the quotation.\n\n2.\tDo you agree with the saying, “Might is right”?\nThe question Do you agree with the saying? is outside the quotation.\n\nRule 9\nIf a quoted question ends in midsentence, the question mark replaces a comma.\n\nExample: “Have you had lunch today?” the man asked.\n\nRule 10\nQuotation marks are often used with technical terms, terms used in an unusual way, or other expressions that vary from standard usage.\n\nExample:\n1. wooing a lady is often referred to as “toasting.” \n\n2. My dad “dashed” me N50,
          000. (Meaning my dad gave me a gift of N50,
          000. Dash in Nigerian \n     parlance means to give someone a gift).\n\nRule 11\nWhen quoted material runs more than one paragraph, start each new paragraph with opening quotation marks, but do not use closing quotation marks until the end of the passage.\n\n\n        "brackets context"\n        # BRACKETS () []\n\n## Round Brackets ()\nUse round brackets to separate off information that is not essential to the meaning of the rest of the sentence.\n\nExample: Mike Tyson (in the 1990s) was the heavy weight boxing champion.\n\n## Square Brackets []\nSquare brackets are mainly used to enclose words added by someone other than the original writer or speaker, typically in order to clarify the situation:\n\nExample: Mrs Ifi [the lecturer
          ] is always polite to her students\n\nIf brackets are used at the end of a sentence, the full stop should be placed outside, as the final punctuation:\n\nExample: A good knowledge of the use of the computer is a basic requirement (at least to be able to secure a good job).\n\n\n        "foreign_words context"\n        # FOREIGN WORDS\nAs much as possible, avoid using foreign words except very well-known ones. Where you choose to use foreign words, they should be italicised. \n\n\n        "gender context"\n        # GENDER AND INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE\n\nRule 1\nWhen there is a choice between a word which specifies a person\'s gender and a word which does not, you should choose the neutral one unless their gender is relevant to the context. \n\nExample: Use chair or chairperson instead of chairman, or head teacher instead of headmaster/headmistress. \n\nOn the other hand, it would sound improper to say, for example, ‘she is the best head teacher’ instead of ‘she is the best head mistress’,\n\nRule 2\nIf you want to refer to humanity in general, use phrases such as the human race or humankind rather than mankind.\n\nRule 3\nIf you are making general statements, avoid using specific gender pronouns like, he, she, him, her, herself, himself; except where the gender of the person is known. You can use plural pronouns like, they, their, them, themselves (or themself), which can also be used to refer to singular nouns.\n\n\n\n        "slashes context"\n        # SLASHES\nSlash Marks (/)\nThis is used to represent exclusive or inclusive, or division and fractions. It is also used as a date separator.\n\nRules\n\uf0a7\tDo not use a slash mark as a substitute for or. If the user interface uses a slash in this way, follow the interface in describing the label, but use or in describing the corresponding action.\n\uf0a7\tIn the user interface, an ellipsis is typically used to show truncation, as in a programme name, or to indicate on menus and in dialog boxes that a dialog box will appear to obtain more information from the user. Do not use an ellipsis in this context in documentation.\n\uf0a7\tUse a slash mark in constructions that imply a combination. \n\uf0a7\tUse a slash mark to separate parts of an Internet address (use a double slash after the protocol name): \\\\server\\CypherCrescent File Services\\cyphercrescent staff\\User \n\n        "business_emails context"\n        # BASICS OF A BUSINESS EMAIL\n\n## From; To; Cc; Bcc\n\uf0a7\tFrom refers to the sender or source of the mail. \n\uf0a7\tTo refers to the recipient(s) of the mail.\n\uf0a7\tCc refers to parties that are copied in a mail.\n\uf0a7\tBcc refers to parties to be blind copied in a mail\n\nHow to Reply a Mail\nWhen replying a mail with other people in copy, reply to everyone and ensure no one in the originating mail is left out.\n## Subject Line\nA good subject line must be S. P. A. M.\nS – Short\nP – Personable\nA – Attention-getting\nM – Meaningful to the reader\n\n1. Short\nThe subject line should have a maximum of 49 characters. The characters also include spaces.\n\n2. Personable\nThe subject line should appeal to and relate personally to the reader. Imagine what the reader wants to hear from you and use that knowledge to craft the subject lines.\n\n3. Attention-getting\nThe subject line most importantly, aims at grabbing the reader’s attention. One way to do this is using humour. Humour is a wonderful way to attract attention to emails as long as it is relevant and suitable to the readers. \n\n4. Meaningful to the reader\nSubject lines of emails should be meaningful to the readers. To achieve this, the following should be adhered to:\n\n\n\uf071\tExclusivity\nEmail subject lines should imply exclusivity. Subject lines about special services to clients, VIP invitations and privileges can make the readers feel really privileged, and therefore more likely to open the email.\n\n\uf071\tSpecificity\nSubject lines should address specific issues or items that relate to the readers. Vagueness or ambiguity should be avoided.\n\n\uf071\tBelievability\nBelievability implies that subject lines should be credible enough to the readers. Don’t promise something with your subject line that you don’t deliver on in the body of the message. There should be consistency between the subject line and the body of the message.\n\nSubject Line Mistakes to Avoid\n1.\tTHE ALL-CAPS SCREAMER \nAvoid all caps in your subject lines because it sounds like you are yelling at your readers. This also applies to the body of the message.\n\n\n2.\tThe Punctuation Abuser!!!!!\nLike all-caps, punctuations should not be abused. When you use more than one punctuation mark it will seem as if you are yelling (!!!). One exclamation point or one question mark serves its purpose.\n\n3.\tThe Generic Nature\nSubject lines should be specific in nature. Avoid the use of subject lines that are generic. Telling the recipients what exactly to expect in the mail will go a long way in making them read the mail. \n\t\nGeneric subject lines such as “Weekly Updates,” “Monthly Review” or “Daily Highlights” are not enticing or descriptive enough. It is ideal to always highlight your most interesting topics in the subject line.\n\n4.\tThe Desperate Crier, i.e. “Open Me!”\nBegging for an open makes you sound desperate and will not give you the engagement you desire. \n\n5.\tThe Grammar or Spelling Mistake Eyesore\nPrevent grammar and spelling errors by using spell check; ask at least one other person to proofread your entire email including the subject line.\n6.3\tSalutation\nUse the recipient’s first name in the greeting when you have a friendly relationship with the recipient. \n\nGreeting: Dear Chukwuemeka,\nUse a courtesy title, a professional title and a last name when you have a formal relationship with the recipient.\n\nGreeting: Dear Mr Chukwuemeka,  \nDear Prof. Chukwuemeka                    \n\nUse a title and a last name when you writing to someone who is much older than you or someone you hold in high esteem.\n\nUse the title “Miss” or “Mrs” when you are sure that a woman would prefer to be addressed as such. Otherwise use the title Ms or leave the title out.\n\nUse “Miss” for a young girl who is less than 18, “Ms” for an unmarried woman who is above 18 and for a woman whose marital status you are not sure of, and “Mrs” for a married woman.\n\nUse “Master” for a young boy who is less than 18, “Mr” for both a man who is above 18 and a married man. \n\nMses is for more than one woman with the title “Ms”. \n\nMessrs is for more than one man with the title Mr. Its use is quite formal and traditional. You may use Mr. with each man’s name instead.       \n\nFor communications outside Nigeria, use “Mx” when you write to someone who prefers a gender-neutral courtesy title. If you have transgender friends and associates, find out which courtesy titles they prefer.\n\nBody of the Email\na.\tIntroductory Statement\nSome suggested introductory statements are:\n\uf0a7\tThank you for your email…\n\uf0a7\tThank you for visiting our Technology Centre…\n\nb.\tBackground Information\nBackground information should be preceded by statements such as:\n\uf0a7\tFurther to our discussion…\n\uf0a7\tWe are pleased to inform you…\n\nOther Rules to Observe in the Body of the Email\n\uf0a7\tKeep your mail simple and focused, so the purpose of your mail is clear.\n\uf0a7\tThe first paragraph should include an introduction and a brief explanation of your reason for writing. \n\uf0a7\tThe second paragraph (and any following paragraphs) should explain further your reasons for writing. \n\uf0a7\tThe final paragraph should reiterate the reason you are writing and thank the reader for reviewing your request.\n\uf0a7\tSingle space your letter and justify your letter to the left. Leave a blank line between each paragraph.\n\uf0a7\tSingle space your letter and leave a space between each paragraph\n\uf0a7\tLeft justify your letter, so that your contact information, the date, the letter, and your signature are all aligned to the left.\n\uf0a7\tUse a plain font like Calibri, which is the approved font for official communications.\n## Complimentary Closing\nWhen you do not use the name of the recipient. \nWhen you use “Dear Sir” or “Dear Madam” as the salutation, the complimentary closing will be “Yours faithfully”, not Yours Faithfully, not Yours sincerely.\n\nWhen you use the name of the recipient in the salutation.\nFor example, “Dear Mr Friday” or “Dear Mrs Kate” as the salutation. \n\nThe complimentary closing will be “Yours sincerely”, not Your Sincerely, not Yours Faithfully.\n\nThe invented title Ms. has widely displaced Miss on both sides of the Atlantic. Ms conflates Miss and Mrs to provide a feminine form that, like Mr, does not indicate marital status. \nBritish usage: Ms Jones\nAmerican usage: Ms. Jones\n\n\n        "acronyms context"\n        # ACRONYMS\n\nAn acronym is a word formed from the initial letters of each word of a compound term. The word is pronounced as spelt and no full stops are used.\n\nRules for Acronyms\n\nRule 1\nWrite acronyms in uppercase. \n\nExample: AKA, TGIF, ATM, FAQ.\n\nRule 2\nIf the acronym has four letters or more and is pronounceable, we may use upper and lowercase. \n\nExample: Captcha Gestapo, Interpol, Sim (card). \n\nRule 3\nWrite out the full name of an acronym in brackets when first mentioned with the acronym. Subsequently, you could only use the acronym.\n\nRule 4\nThere is no need to write out some familiar acronyms.\n\nExample: Aids, Unicef.\n\nRule 5\nContemporary acronyms do not need full stops. \n\nExample: SEPAL, US, NATO, etc.\n\n\n        "spellings context" \n        # SPELLINGS\nThe official editorial language style of CypherCrescent Limited is the British Style. This is our preferred linguistic, spelling style and date format.\nIn other to reduce any conflict in spelling and ensure consistency in spelling, an attempt has been made to create a comprehensive list of spellings as a guide. However, the Collins dictionary (UK preferred spellings) can be used as a spelling guide for words that were not captured in the spelling list below. \n\n \nA\n

preserve an intended information transmission from sender to receiver both in informal and formal communication settings. It is an important aspect of writing as it relates directly to the organisation of the written document, whereas, improper use of capitalisation can greatly affect the semantics and structure of the written document. \nThe purpose of capitalisation is to help show the reader the importance of different words. For example, let us look at how capitalisation can show importance with some nouns. Remember, a noun is the person, place, thing, or idea. \n\nLook at these two phrases: \'The White House\' and \'the white house.\' Because the first phrase is capitalised, you as the reader know it is more important. Capitalised, it refers to the house the President of the United States lives in; lowercase, it refers to any house that is white. In this example, you can see how capitalisation shows the clear meaning of words.\n\n## Forms of Capitalisation\nThe common forms of capitalisation are:\n1.\tUpper Case Capitalisation: when all the letters in a sentence are capitalised \nExample: EDITORIAL STYLE GUIDE\n2.\tLower case capitalisation: when all the letters in a sentence are not capitalised\nExample: editorial style guide\n3.\tTitle Case Capitalisation: only the first letter of each word in a sentence is capitalised \nExample: Editorial Style Guide\n4.\tSentence Case Capitalisation: only the first letter of the word starting the sentence is capitalised\nExample: Editorial style guide\n5.\tToggle Case Capitalisation: any letter of the word can be capitalised in no particular order, this is usually done for aesthetic reasons. \nExample: EditoRiaL stYle GuiDe\nNote: This type of capitalisation is not used in CypherCrescent.\n\nN/B: The upper, lower and toggle case capitalisation types are not exactly challenging. The complication in capitalisation lies with the title case and sentence case capitalisation.\n\n## Rules of Capitalisation\nThere are standard rules of capitalisations set globally for effective communication. These rules serve as guides to the proper use of capitalisation in writing. \nCapitalise the First Word of a Sentence\n\nCapitalise the first word of a sentence.\nExample\n\uf0a7\tA good developer should enjoy coding and scripting. \n\uf0a7\tData sorting and structuring are recommended activities before an effective engineering analysis.\n\uf0a7\tWhat is the official closing time?\nCapitalise proper nouns\nA proper noun is a name used for a person, place, or organisation, spelled with an initial capital letter, e.g. Ahmed, Port Harcourt, Nigeria, United Nations.\n\nCapitalise names of relatives (to indicate family relationship) when used with name\nExample\n\uf0a7\tWe decided to visit Aunty Favour and not our other aunties.\nCapitalise names of relatives when used as proper name\nExample\n\uf0a7\tShe ate with Uncle and not with her aunty.\nCapitalise titles\nCapitalise titles –\ni.\tWhen a title precedes a name.\nExample\nMany civil servants came out to welcome Governor Wike.       \nii.\tDo not capitalise titles that follow names.\nExample\nMany civil servants came out to welcome the governor. \n\niii.\tCapitalise titles when used in direct address.\nExample\nWe the civil servants urge you, Governor, to pay up all our financial entitlements.\n9.3. \tAdditional Notes on Capitalisation\nCapitalise very high-ranking government officials’ titles even when not followed by a name or used in direct address when a specific individual is referred to\nExample\nThe ministers are loyal to the President of Nigeria.\nIf no specific individual is referred to, do not capitalise titles of even very high-ranking government officials\nExample\nNigerians will prefer a president who will sincerely fight corruption.\nCapitalise important words in compound titles used with names, but do not capitalise prefixes or suffixes added to the titles.\nExample\nThe civil servants were excited when the Governor-elect visited them.\nCapitalise directions that are names, such as North, South, East, and West when used as sections of the country\nExample\nThe South-South people of Nigeria are agitating for resource control.\nDo not capitalise directions when used as compass directions.\nExample\nMr Frank lives one kilometre south of the River Benue.\nCapitalise days of the week, months of the year, and holidays.\nExample\nFriday, May, Democracy Day\nCapitalise seasons, when used in a title.\nExample\nThis Summer Olympics will be the most memorable.\n\nDo not capitalise the names of seasons if they are used generally.\nExample\nThis harmattan has been the harshest in recent years.\nCapitalise intellectual property rights.\nExample\nSEPAL, Toyota, Pepsi, Honda, WhatsApp\nNote: Capitalisation in registered trademarks must be consistent with the trademarks.\nCapitalise the first word in a sentence that is a direct quote, even if the direct quote comes in the middle of a sentence.\nExample\nThe employees asked, “Can we resume on Monday?”\nCapitalise the first word of a sentence following a colon if it is a complete sentence.\nExample\nAll through the meeting, James was quiet: He lost a bet.\nDo not capitalise the first word of a list following a colon if the list is not a complete sentence.\nExample\nThe teacher told the students to bring the following items to school: pens, notebooks, wrist-watch.\n\n\n        "full_stops context"\n        # FULL STOPS (.)\nThe full stop is the simplest of the punctuation marks to use.\nGenerally, full stops are placed at the end of a sentence to signify a break. However, full stops have several other applications in technical writing. \nRule 1\nIt is used at the end of a sentence.\n\nExample: She is a happy girl.\n\nRule 2\nIt is used at the end of an indirect question.\n\nExample: I am asking what your name is.\n\nRule 3\nIt is used in abbreviations.\n\nExample: My month of graduation is Feb. 2016.\n\nRule 4\nIt is used at the end of a command.\n\nExample: Stand up.\n\nRule 5\nIt used in numbers.\n\nExample: 55.7 (fifty-five point seven)\n\n\n        "apostrophies context"\n        # APOSTROPHES\nApostrophe (‘)\nApostrophe is used to indicate either possession (e.g., Anita\'s book) or the omission of letters or numbers (e.g., can’t; class of ’99).\n\nRule 1:\nForm the possessive case of a singular noun by adding an apostrophe and an s, even if the singular noun ends in s, x, or z. \n\nExample: I know that both Mr Silas and Miss Juan have dogs, but I do not know if Mr Silas’s dogs are wild.\n\nRule 2: \nFor plural nouns that end in s, form the possessive case by adding only an apostrophe. \n\nExample: From the election results, it is clear Donald Trump was the masses’ choice.)\n\nGuide\n\uf0a7\tFor plural nouns that end in s, form the possessive case by adding only an apostrophe. (e.g., From the election results, it is clear Donald Trump was the masses’ choice.)\n\uf0a7\tAvoid forming possessives from company names.\n\uf0a7\tDo not use the possessive form of product names or feature names.\n\uf0a7\tDifferentiate between the contraction it’s (it is) and possessive pronoun its.\n\uf0a7\tNever use an apostrophe with possessive pronouns (yours, not your’s).\n\uf0a7\tDo not use an apostrophe to indicate the plural of a singular noun (programmes, not programme’s).\n\n\n        "money context"\n        # MONEY\n\nRule 1\nCurrency symbols should be placed before the number, with no spaces.\n\nExample: His monthly remuneration is N200,
          000.\n\nRule 2\nThousands should be separated by commas.\n\nExample: Ken was fortunate to find N5,
          000 in his bag. \n\n\nRule 3\nDecimals should be separated by full stops.\n\nExample: Fred’s total tax for the month is N550.88. \n\nRule 4 \nWhen you reach numbers in the millions and billions, write out the full word (instead of all those zeros).\n\nExample: The total value of the newly awarded contract is N2.5 billion. \n\nRule 5\nDo not write out the currency if you\'ve already indicated an amount with a currency symbol.\n\nExample: I just received a credit alert of N10 million from my bank. AND NOT\nI just received a credit alert of N10 million naira from my bank. \n\n\n        "abbreviation context"\n        # ABBREVIATIONS, TITLES, AND CONTRACTIONS\n\nTitles are used to address individuals and personalities. Most titles are often abbreviated. If the title or abbreviation ends with the same letter that ends the word, no full stop is necessary:\nMr (Mister)\nMrs (Mistress)\nDr (Doctor)\nEngr (Engineer)\nParas (Paragraphs)\n\nIf the abbreviation ends with a letter other than the one that ends the whole word, a full stop is called for:\nProf. (Professor) \nCapt. (Captain)\nArch. (Architect)\n\n1.1\tOther Examples of Abbreviations\nPara. (Paragraph)\nDr. (Drive)\netc. (et cetera)\ne.g. (Exempli gratia)\ni.e. (id est) \n\n\n        "numbers context"\n        # NUMBERS\n\nRule 1. \nSpell out all numbers beginning a sentence.\nExample:\nTwenty-five students were present in the class.\n\nException:\nWhen a year begins a sentence, you do not need to spell it out.\n\nExample:\n2019 is a promising year.\nRule 2a\nHyphenate all compound numbers from twenty-one through ninety-nine.\nExample:\nTwenty-five passengers were in the bus. \nRule 2b. Hyphenate all written-out fractions.\nExample:\nWe recovered about two-thirds of the stolen cash.\nOne-half is slightly less than five-eighths.\n\nHowever, do not hyphenate terms like a third or a half.\n\nRule 3a. With figures of four or more digits, use commas. Count three spaces to the left to place the first comma. Continue placing commas after every three digits. \n\nImportant: Do not include decimal points when doing the counting.\nExample:\n2,
          250 people\nN1,
          500,
          000.35\n\nNote: Some choose not to use commas with four-digit numbers, but this practice is not recommended.\n\nRule 3b \nIt is not necessary to use a decimal point or a Naira (currency) sign when writing out sums of less than a naira.\n\nNot Advised: He had only N0.50.\nBetter:\nHe had only fifty kobo.\nOR\nHe had only 50 kobo.\n\nRule 3c. Do not add the word "kobo" or “Naira” to figures preceded by a naira sign.\nIncorrect: I have N1,
          250 naira in my bank account.\nCorrect: I have N1,
          250 in my bank account.\n\nRule 4b \nUsing numerals for the time of day has become widely accepted.\n\nExample:\nThe flight leaves at 6: 22 a.m.\nPlease arrive by 12: 30 p.m. sharp.\nHowever, we could also spell out the time, particularly when using o\'clock.\n\nExample:\nShe takes the four forty-five flight.\nThe baby wakes up at five o\'clock in the morning.\n\nRule 5\nMixed fractions are often expressed in figures unless they begin a sentence.\n\nExample:\nWe expect a 7 1/2 percent wage increase from the government.\nSeven and one-half percent was the expected wage increase from the government.\n\nRule 6. The simplest way to express large numbers is usually best.\n\nExample: Twenty-nineteen (simpler than two thousand and nineteen)\nLarge round numbers are often spelled out; but be consistent within a sentence.\n\nExample:\nConsistent: You can earn from one million to five million naira.\nInconsistent: You can earn from one million naira to 5 million naira.\nInconsistent: You can earn from N1 million to five million naira.\n\nRule 7. Write decimals using figures. As a courtesy to readers, many writers put a zero in front of the decimal point.\n\nExample:\nThe plant grew 0.55 inches last year.\nThe plant grew only 0.05 inches this year.\n\nRule 8a. When writing out a number of three or more digits, the word “and” is not necessary. However, use the word “and” to express any decimal points that may accompany these numbers.\n\nExample:\nFive thousand one hundred fifty-five naira\nFive thousand one hundred fifty-five naira and thirty-five kobo\n\nRule 8b. When writing out numbers above 999, do not use commas.\nIncorrect: Five thousand, one hundred fifty-five naira, and thirty-five kobo\nCorrect: Five thousand one hundred fifty-five naira and thirty-five kobo\n\n\n        "commas context"\n        # COMMAS (,)\n\nRule 1\nComma is used to separate items in a list, words or group of words.\nExample:\n1.\tThe manager told the staff to bring to work their identification cards, offer letters, and payslips.\n2.\tThe newly elected president promised the citizens of the country increased minimum wage, improved housing, better healthcare, and free education.\n\nRule 2\nUse a comma to separate two adjectives when the order of the adjectives is interchangeable.\n\nExample:\n1.\tPort Harcourt is a clean, beautiful city.\nWe could also say: Port Harcourt is a beautiful, clean city.\n\n2.\tThe tourists lodged in an expensive holiday resort\nWe would not say: The tourists lodged in a holiday expensive resort.\n\nIn the above example, comma is not needed.\n\nAnother way to determine if a comma is needed is to mentally put and between the two adjectives. If the result still makes sense, add the comma. In the examples above, a clean and beautiful city makes sense, but an expensive and holiday resort does not.\n\nRule 3\nIn sentences where two independent clauses are joined by connectors such as and, or, but, etc., put a comma at the end of the first clause.\n\nExample:\nIncorrect: He took his child to school and he drove the car.\nCorrect: He took his child to school, and he drove the car.\nSome writers omit the comma if the clauses are short.\n\nExample:\nI am fair and she is dark.\n\nRule 4\nIf the subject does not appear in front of the second verb, a comma is generally unnecessary.\n\nExample: \nShe left her office but did not take her car key.\n\nRule 5\nWhen starting a sentence with a dependent clause, use a comma after it.\n\nExample: \nIf you are happy with me, join me to celebrate.\n\nFollow the same principle with introductory phrases.\n\nExample: \nWith the stage fully set, the dancers trooped out to perform.\n\nRule 6\nA comma is usually unnecessary when the sentence starts with an independent clause followed by a dependent clause.\n\nExample: \nPlease inform the manager if you are not coming to work.\n\nRule 7\nUse commas to set off nonessential words, clauses, and phrases.\n\nExample: \nIncorrect: Jane the janitor swept the floor.\nCorrect: Jane, the janitor, swept the floor.\nIncorrect: The students know that they were wrong refused to take correction.\nCorrect: The students, knowing they were wrong, refused to take corrections.\n\nOther examples:\nIncorrect: My cousin, Mike arrived.\nCorrect: My cousin, Mike, arrived.\nIncorrect: The three employees, Amina, Kola, and Jane are off duty.\nCorrect: The three employees, Amina, Kola, and Jane, are off duty.\n\nRule 8\nIf something or someone is sufficiently identified, the description that follows is considered nonessential and should be surrounded by commas.\n\nExample:\n1. Amaka, who has the book, is in the classroom.\nIf we already know which Amaka is meant, the description is not essential.\n\n2. The girl who has the book is in the classroom.\nWe do not know which girl is meant without further description; therefore, no commas are used.\nRule 9\nUse a comma after certain words that introduce a sentence, such as well, yes, why, hello, hey, etc.\n\nExample:\n1. Why, I can\'t believe this!\n2. No, you can\'t have a dollar.\n\nRule 10\nUse commas to set off the name, nickname, term of endearment, or title of a person directly addressed.\n\nExample:\n1. Will you, Nkem, do me this favour?\n2. Yes, my dear, I will.\n3. Good day, Teacher.\n\nRule 11\nUse a comma to separate the day of the month from the year, and—what most people forget!—always put one after the year, also.\n\nExample: \nIt was in the Guardian’s March 05,
          2018, edition.\nNo comma is necessary for just the month and year.\n\nExample: It was in a March 2018 article.\n\nRule 12\nUse a comma to separate a city from its state, and remember to put one after the state, also.\n\nExample:\nI\'m from Port Harcourt, South-South, region.\n\nRule 13\nUse commas to introduce or interrupt direct quotations.\n\nExample:\nHe said, "I don\'t care."\n"Why," I asked, "don\'t you care?"\n\nRule 14\nIf the quotation comes before he said, she wrote, they reported, Dana insisted, or a similar attribution, end the quoted material with a comma, even if it is only one word.\nExample:\n1. "I don\'t care," he said.\n2. "Stop," he said.\n\nRule 15\nIf a quotation functions as a subject or object in a sentence, it might not need a comma.\n\nExample:\n1. Is "I don\'t care" all you can say to me?\n2. Saying "Stop the car" was a mistake.\n\nRule 16\nIf a quoted question ends in midsentence, the question mark replaces a comma.\n\nExample: \n"Will you still be my friend?" she asked.\n\nRule 17\nUse a comma to separate a statement from a question.\n\nExample: \nI can go, can\'t I?\n\nRule 18\nUse a comma to separate contrasting parts of a sentence.\n\nExample: \nThat is my money, not yours.\n\nRule 18\nUse a comma before and after certain introductory words or terms, such as namely, that is, i.e., e.g., and for instance, when they are followed by a series of items.\n\nExample: \nYou may be required to bring many items, e.g., sleeping bags, pans, and warm clothing.\n\nRule 19\nA comma should precede the term etc. Many authorities also recommend a comma after etc. when it is placed midsentence.\n\nExample: \nSleeping bags, pans, warm clothing, etc., are in the tent.\n\n## Serial Commas\nThe serial comma (sometimes referred to as the Oxford comma) is usually the final comma in a list of things.\n\nUse serial commas in a list of things.\n\nExample: The student had in his bag a pen, an eraser, and books.\n\n\n        "colons context"\n        # COLONS AND SEMICOLONS\n\n## Colons (:)\n\nA colon is used to indicate:\n1.\tThe introduction of a quotation or a list of items, and (e.g., Well schematic components: parker and blast joint, etc. are inventible requirements to complete a well). \n\n2.\tThe separation of two clauses of which the second expands or illustrates the first. (e.g., SEPAL: The innovative well and reservoir management solution.)\n\nGuide\n\uf0a7\tUse a colon at the end of a sentence or phrase that introduces a list.\n\uf0a7\tDo not capitalise the word following a colon within a sentence unless the word is a proper noun or the text following the colon is a complete sentence. However, always capitalise the first word of each item in a list. \n\uf0a7\tUse a colon to separate the title of a book or article from its subtitle. (e.g., SEPAL User Guide: Launching SEPAL.)\n\uf0a7\tUse only one space after a colon in both online and printed text. \n\uf0a7\tUse colons to introduce quotations that are formal or lengthy.  (e.g., The Asset Manager said: SEPAL has added tremendous value to our asset management experience.)\n\n## Semicolons (;)\nSemicolons are used to separate independent clauses in three different cases. \n1.\tWhen there are no conjunctions separating the clauses.\n\nExample\n\uf0a7\tIncorrect: I like SEPAL, Gift likes it too. (Semicolon needed) \n\uf0a7\tCorrect: I like SEPAL; Gift likes it too.\n\n2.\tWhen the clauses are separated by a conjunctive adverb or other parenthetical expression set off by commas.\n\nExample\n\uf0a7\tThe Pecon database development project is demanding; nevertheless, I enjoy the experience. \n(“Nevertheless” is a conjunctive adverb.) \n\n3. \tWhen the clauses themselves contain commas. \n\nExample\n\uf0a7\tBernard prefers the PowerPoint format, the static format; but Osa prefers the XML format.\n(Since clause already has comma, semicolon separating the clauses is needed to make sentence clear.) \n\n\n        "contacts context"\n        # CONTACT DETAILS\n\n## Writing Phone Numbers\nRule 1:\nWhen writing to a local recipient, local phone numbers are to be written as follows: 08021000200\n\nRule 2:\nWhen writing to a foreign recipient, local phones numbers are to be written as follows: \n(+234) 8021000200\n\nRule 3:\nForeign phone numbers are to be written as follows: (+123) 80210002000\n\n## Writing Email Addresses\nRule 1:\nWrite email addresses in lower case. \n\nRule 2:\nWhen an email address ends in a sentence, do not follow it with a full stop as it could obstruct users copying the address.\n\nExample:\nFor more information, you can contact info.ccl@ccl.ng \n\n\n        "ellipses context"\n        # ELLIPSES (…)\nAn ellipsis is a punctuation mark consisting of three dots.\n\nRule 1:\nUse an ellipsis when omitting a word, phrase, line, paragraph, or more from a quoted passage. \n\nExample: \nFull quotation: "As your leaders, we are committed to your better welfare, development, and overall satisfaction.” \n\nWith ellipsis:\n"As your leaders, we are committed to your… overall satisfaction.”\n\nNote: There should be no space between the last character preceding the ellipsis. But there should be just one space between the ellipsis and the next character as seen in the example above.\n\nRule 2:\nEllipses could be used at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence.\n\nRule 3:\nUse ellipses to express hesitation, changes of mood, suspense, or thoughts trailing off. Writers also use ellipses to indicate a pause or wavering in an otherwise straightforward sentence.\n\nExample:\n1. He called… But there was no answer\n2. I’m so happy because…\n\n\n        "dashes context"\n        # DASHES AND HYPHENS\nDashes and hyphens are different. Dashes separate words into parenthetical statements, while hyphens join two or more words together into a compound word. \n\nHyphens are not separated by spaces, while a dash has a space on either side.\n13.1 \tEm Dashes (—)\nThe em dash is usually the widest of the en dash and the hyphen.\n\nThere are two types of dashes, which are:\n•\tThe em dash (—), which is usually longer.\n•\tThe en dash (–), which is usually shorter.\n\nRule 1:\nUse em dash in certain instances to replace some punctuations like, a colon (:), a bracket (), \n\nRule 2:\nUse em dash to replace intentionally omitted letters. In this case, em dash could appear in pairs or threesomes.\n\nExample: A generous donor, – – –, offered to pay for the child’s medical bill.\n\nRule 3:\nDo not use more than two em dashes in a sentence except when you use them to replace intentionally omitted letters.\n\nRule 4:\nThere should be no spaces on either side of the em dash.    \n\n## En Dashes (–)\nThe en dash is usually shorter than the em dash and longer than the hyphen.\n\nRule 1:\nThe en dash is often used to indicate spans of time or ranges of numbers. \n\nExample: The required age for the interview is between ages 18 - 20. \n\nRule 2:\nThe en dash could be used in place of versus.\n\nExample:\nThe Nigeria–Argentina world cup match was very entertaining.\n\nRule 3:\nUse the en dash to show a pairing or partnership.\n\nExample:\nThe Nigeria–Ghana bilateral relationship has yielded tremendous economic results to both countries.\n\nRule 4:\nTo keep construction parallel, do not use the en dash with the word “from”.\n\nExample: \nThe required age for the interview is from 18 to 20. (Correct)\nThe required age for the interview is from 18 – 20. (Wrong) \n\nTo find em dash and en dash, use the “insert symbol” command.\n\n## Hyphens (-)\nUsage  \n\uf0a7\tThe hyphen is used to join compound words or words that are linked in the grammar of a sentence (e.g in-house technology, rock-forming).\n\uf0a7\tUse a hyphen to indicate the division of a word at the end of a line, or to indicate a missing or implied element (e.g. short- and long-term).\n\uf0a7\tUse a hyphen between the tens and units number when writing out the numbers twenty-one to ninety-nine in words. Just like that! Do not use hyphens for other numbers. \nExample\nIncorrect: Two-hundred-fifty-six.\nCorrect: Two hundred fifty-six.\n(Use hyphen between tens and units only.) \n\uf0a7\tUse a hyphen between the numerator and denominator when a fraction is written out in words and the fraction is an adjective. \nExample\nIncorrect: Two-thirds of the Senate overrode the veto. \n(Here two thirds is a noun, not an adjective.) \nCorrect: Two thirds of the Senate overrode the veto. \nIncorrect: A two thirds majority overrode the veto. \n(Here two thirds is an adjective modifying majority.) \nCorrect: A two-thirds majority overrode the veto. \n\uf0a7\tUse a colon at the end of a sentence or phrase that introduces a list.\n\uf0a7\tDo not capitalise the word following a colon within a sentence unless the word is a proper noun or the text following the colon is a complete sentence. However, always capitalise the first word of each item in a list. \n\uf0a7\tUse a colon to separate the title of a book or article from its subtitle. (e.g., SEPAL User Guide: Launching SEPAL.)\n\uf0a7\tUse only one space after a colon in both online and printed text. \n\uf0a7\tUse colons to introduce quotations that are formal or lengthy.  (e.g., The Asset Manager said: SEPAL has added tremendous value to our asset management experience.)\n\uf0a7\tHyphens within a word can make some words clearer. \n\uf0a7\tThey are frequently used with prefixes ending with the same vowel as the root begins with to show pronunciation or emphasize meaning. \n\uf0a7\tThey are also frequently used to distinguish between words.\nExample\n1.\tco-op (instead of coop, also prefix ending with same vowel as root beginning) \n2.\tre-elect (prefix ending with same vowel as root beginning) \n3.\tre-form the clay pot (instead of reform, which has a different meaning)\n4.\tre-sign a contract (instead of resign, which could mean nearly the opposite) \n\uf0a7\tSometimes words may be combined mistakenly. A hyphen can help the reader understand what is meant. \nExample\nIncorrect: The guard captured five foot soldiers.\n(Is it five-foot soldiers, or five foot-soldiers?) \nCorrect: The guard captured five foot-soldiers.\n\uf0a7\tHyphens can be used as prefixes or suffices (e.g., post-dated, pre-payed.)\n\uf0a7\tHyphens can be used to sustain communication continuity when a line is broken.\n\n\tThe Use of Hyphens in “Single User” and “Multi User”\nAccording to the Microsoft Style Guide, the general principle is that you do not hyphenate words beginning with “multi” unless it is necessary to avoid confusion or if multi is followed by a proper noun.

Parallelism may involve repetition of some words, but more generally involves repetition of parts of speech (e.g. nouns, verbs, adjectives).\n\n## The Use of Parallelism\nExample:\n\uf0a7\tIfeanyi enjoys reading his books, watching movies, and plays football  X  \n\uf0a7\tTola enjoys reading her books, watching movies, and playing volley football √\n\uf0a7\tAkpan receives information, gives information, and analyses information  √\n\uf0a7\tGerard receives information, gives information, and analysed information X  \n\nThe newly elected president promised the citizens of the country increased minimum wage, improved housing, better healthcare, and free education.\n\nOther examples of parallelism:  \n\uf0a7\tEarn, eat, and exercise\n\uf0a7\tGrow, glow, gloat\n\uf0a7\tPlan, preach, and proclaim\nThe above examples have the following common features:\ni.\tThey are all alliterations with the letters “E”, “G”, and “P”.\nii.\tThey are all verbs\nA bad example of parallelism will be:\n\uf0a7\tEarn, living, and to play\n\uf0a7\tStudying, beneficial, and remedy.\n\uf0a7\tOrange, apple, banana, and bicycle\n\n1.\tParallelism is used to balance verbs with verbs, nouns with nouns, prepositional phrases with prepositional phrases, participles with participles, infinitives with infinitives and clauses with clauses. \nExample\n\uf0a7\tKuro is a good developer; he enjoys looping and editing his scripts.\n\uf0a7\tData sorting and structuring are recommended activities before an effective engineering analysis.\n\uf0a7\tAmara came back from work; had her dinner and went to bed.\n\n2.\tParallelism is used with elements joined by coordinating conjunctions.\nExample\n\uf0a7\tDaniel likes reading and solving optimisation problems.\n\uf0a7\tDaniel likes to read and to solve optimisation problems.\n\n3.\tParallelism is used with elements in comparison.\nExample\n\uf0a7\tTunde is more excited about drawing new well schematics with SEPAL than working with the previous image file copies. (Correct)\n\uf0a7\tTunde is more excited about drawing new well schematics with SEPAL than work with the previous image file copies. (Wrong)\n\n4.\tParallelism is used with elements joined by linking words.\nExample\n\uf0a7\tOur clients not only want their well and reservoir data digitised but also to reveal potential intervention opportunities.\n\uf0a7\tOur clients want their well and reservoir data not only digitised, but also to reveal potential intervention opportunities.\n\n5.\tParallelism is used with elements in lists or in a series.\nWhen you have a list, maintain parallel construction. Perhaps the most important factor affecting the meaning and coherence of a list within a sentence is parallel construction: all the items in the list need to have the same logical and grammatical structure. \nThat is to say, the items in the list need to be: all single words of the same part of speech (e.g., all nouns, all adjectives, and all verbs); all phrases of the same structure (e.g., all verbal phrases, all noun phrases, and all prepositional phrases); all subordinate clauses; or all main clauses (i.e., full sentences). \n\nExample\nSammy and his sister are very talented in:\n\uf0a7\tdetermining optimal well production rates, \n\uf0a7\tsolving and teaching partial differential equations,\n\uf0a7\tanalysing and recreate production trends, and\n\uf0a7\tpreparing African dishes.\n\n\n        "figures_tables context"\n        # FIGURES AND TABLES\n\n## Figures\nFigures should be numbered as follows:\nFigure 1, Figure 2, etc., and not Fig 1, Fig 2, etc.\n\n# TABLES\n## Tables\nRule 1:\nTables should all have a uniform alignment, either left, centre, right, or justified.\n\nRule 2:\nTables should be numbered accordingly. \n\nRule 3:\nItems in the table should be numbered properly and serially.\n\n\nGuidelines for labelling images, figures, and tables for easy referencing\n\n\nPlease add content/guidelines\n\n\n\n        "ampersand context"\n        # AMPERSANDS (&)\n\t An ampersand refers to the sign “&” and it is a symbol used to represent or in place of the  \n            conjunction “and”.\n\nUses of Ampersands\nThe following are some of the uses of ampersands:\nA.\tAs part of an official name (formal and informal). \nSome businesses and enterprises can incorporate the ampersand into their official names. Some well-known examples include: Johnson & Johnson, Dolce & Gabbana. \n\nB.\t As part of a descriptive clause (informal)\nAn ampersand could be used to bring together words or phrases that are separate. Also, when several items are listed together, an ampersand could be used to tie them together.\n\nFor example, you might write: My favourite snacks for lunch are meat pie, soft drink, biscuits & gravy, and bacon & eggs.\n\nC.\tAs shorthand for “and” (informal). \nThe most frequent use of an ampersand is as a substitute for the word “and.”\nRules Use of Ampersands\n           Rule 1\nSpell out words instead of using ampersands in sentences. Using the ampersand as shorthand for “and” is informal writing.\n\nRule 2\nUse the ampersand where it is a registered brand or business name. \n\nExample: AT&T, Procter & Gamble\n\nRule 3\nUse the ampersand when addressing a letter to a couple.\n\nExample: Mr & Mrs Smith, James & Jane Mat\n \nRule 4\nDo not use serial commas with the ampersand.\n\nExample:\nMax, Den, & Don (wrong)\nMax, Den & Don (right)\n\nRule 5\nPlace line breaks after the ampersand, not before it.\n\nExample:\nThe students paid a visit to Max, Den\n& Don during the holidays (wrong)\n\nThe students paid a visit to Max, Den &\nDon during the holidays (right)\n\n        \n        "alphabetisation context"\n        # ALPHABETISATION\n\nAlphabetisation means to alphabetically arrange a series, list, or file. \n\nIt is done in the following ways:\n\nThe A-B-C Order\nThis is done by placing words in a series or list in an A-B-C order, according to the first letter of each word.\n\nExample: Account, Budget, Cost\n\nIf the First Letters are the Same\nIf the first letters are the same, look out for the second letters. If the second letters are the same, look out for the third letters, etc.\n\nExample: Account, Affirm, Appoint, \n\nAlphabetising Titles\nDo not consider articles like, “a”, “an”, and “the” as part of the title. Place those articles at the end of the title and separate them with a comma.\n\nExample:\nCompany Profile, The\nShareholders’ Details, The\nAnnual Report, An\n\n        \n        "INPUT": {input

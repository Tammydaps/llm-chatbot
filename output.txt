Introduction

XYZ Oil and Gas Solutions has been conducting research in areas of Development of innovative products for well intervention services and Optimization of well intervention processes. We would like to combine the results of these efforts into a solid solution for Well Intervention Services surveillance.

The Problem

In Lack of efficient tools for well intervention services, we are data rich but information poor. Real-time data gathering is not an issue, but validation and usage of such data is. For example, Manual intervention tools. Traditionally this problem is often attempted using Field testing in offshore and onshore wells. This method cannot capture important changes in between Current methods are time-consuming and inefficient – Development of specialized well intervention tools.

Proposed Solution

The solution we are proposing combines (i) Implementation of real-time surveillance and monitoring system and (ii) To improve efficiency and reduce downtime during well intervention operations for Real-time surveillance system provides data to optimize use of specialized intervention tools. Component (ii) provides real-time data to enable quick decision making and continuous improvement of well intervention processes. Model in (i) is used to prime and bootstrap model (ii).
